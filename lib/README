Dependencies
============

Bossa requires the following software to run:

 * J2SE 1.2 JRE
   Notes: The newer the better, 1.4 works fine (and fast).
   URL: http://java.sun.com/

 * JAXP 1.2 parser/transformer
   Notes: If you are using J2SE 1.4 these are already provided. Otherwise,
   Jakarta Xalan-Java 2 (which includes a parser) is a good open source
   implementation.
   URL: http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j/

 + Prevayler >=2.00.001
   URL: http://www.prevayler.org/

 + BSF >=cvs20031009

   URL: http://jakarta.apache.org/bsf/

 + Rhino >=1.5R4.1
   URL: http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/

For convenience, we provide an archive with the binaries marked with a +
in our download page. Look for the bossa-dep package with the highest release
number that is smaller or equal the desired bossa release number.

Bossa requires the aditional software to compile:

 * J2SE 1.2 SDK
   Notes: The newer the better, 1.4 works fine (and fast).
   URL: http://java.sun.com/
