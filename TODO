                        A Java workflow engine.
                        =======================

TODO
====

Here are documented possible future features and refactorings of
Bossa. It is an attempt to document the roadmap to the 1.0 version and
as an idea repository.


1.0
===

Major stuff that has to be done before 1.0. 

* Timed transitions: The current implementation only handles
  zero timeout. This will be a bit tricky to implement considering
  that Bossa can be part of an external prevalent system (Bossa will
  generate transactions spontaneously). 

* Upgrade between stable Bossa versions: If the class signature
  changes, it isn't possible to load binary snapshots. Solutions
  include adding a serialVersionUID and handling compatible but
  different implementations, or use XML serialization and provide
  stylesheets to migrate versions.

* Thread safety: Check if the current thread model is
  sufficient. Ensure that it works with a transient Bossa.

* Freeze API: Ideally with a community comment phase.

* Documentation: We need to document all the stuff created since 0.3.1
  until 1.0.
  - Notification bus, transient Bossa, Bossa factory, history, timed
  transitions, administrative functions (set state, open close case,
  etc.), case type XML import, etc.
  - Document case type modeling with more examples, covering all
  modeling techniques that can be used in Bossa (edge weights,
  timeouts, work item resources, etc.). Improve the programmatic and
  XML demo case type. How to use the PNK: how to model, how to set
  attributes, PNML format used.
  - Add more theoretical links in the docs and in the web.


Refactorings
============

Minor stuff that would be great if done before 1.0.

* Use an object to keep the case marking so we can: 1) Simplify
  get/set marking. 2) Simplify state change notification. 3) Atomic
  set all marking, giving consistent evaluation exception in open(),
  close() and cancel().

* CaseType: Unnecessary visibility of all CaseType methods. Use a
  factory to separate case type creation from use. Make CaseType a
  cloneable object.

* Do the XML events export using JDOM.

* Select BSF engines in the Bossa factory.

* Study alternative case indexes: long, string, user set.

* Study problem of setting attributes outside of close().

* A method to discover the attributes more likely to be set upon
  close().

* Add operation to list case attributes to the Bossa Browser.

* Improve test coverage: XML events export.

* Prevayler: 
  - Invisible I/O errors in transaction may happen: file or directory
  removed, filesystem crash, etc. Old PersistenceException in
  javadocs.
  - Incompatibility with rollback mechanism and register case type (it
  changes the transaction object attributes).


Beyond 1.0
==========

Cool stuff for the future.

* A graphical Bossa Browser, maybe web.

* Edge weight compilation for speed.

* Determining resources dynamically.

* Event XML format DTD.
