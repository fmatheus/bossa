* Fully operational workflow engine.

* Workflow defined programmatically using Petri nets as modeling
  abstraction, using JavaScript expressions as edge weights.

* Register, unregister and list workflow definitions (case types).

* List cases, work item and activities by case type or case.

* Handle all life cycle of a workflow task: activation as work item,
  opening the work item as activity and finally the closing or
  cancellation of the activity.

* Resource management, with users and groups organized as access
  control lists.

* Resource specification in the case type using complex set
  expressions.

* Local resources by case type, allowing local mapping between case
  type resources and locally registered resources.

* Local resources by case, allowing more flexible resource
  specification.

* List work items and activities by resource capability.

* Transparent persistence. Uses only a writable directory, nothing
  more. 

* High quality, lightweight, commented and tested Java code.
