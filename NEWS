Bossa 0.5.0 "3.500 BC", 2003-12-XX
----------------------------------

* Added an historian to track events that happened in the engine. It is
  possible to query events by time range and filter them by case type,
  case and resource.

* Added history support to the Bossa Browser to demo the new history
  feature.

* Fixed the resource filtering in the notification bus. Now it works.


Bossa 0.4.1 "Fall", 2003-11-14
------------------------------

* Fixed a wrong access modifier in the constructor of BossaFactory. Now
  it is possible to configure your Bossa instance.

* Fixed a subtle bug caused by the new Prevayler 2.0 transaction filtering.


Bossa 0.4.0 "Maple Leaf", 2003-11-06
------------------------------------

* Updated internally to the Prevayler 2.0 API.

* Added internal notification of events through a notification bus,
  with filtering based on event type and affected resource.

  systems.

Bossa 0.3.1 "Easter Egg", 2003-04-29
------------------------------------

* Added the last bit of API documentation.


Bossa 0.3.0 "Document It and They Will Come", 2003-03-14
--------------------------------------------------------

* We now check if all case variables are set at case type creation
  time.

* Added an optimization in the edge weight evaluation. If the
  expression is an integer it won't go to BSF.

* Added documentation: the overview Bossa Manifesto and an API HOWTO.


Bossa 0.2.1 "A New Hope, Repackaged", 2003-02-25

  dependencies packages). Made a new release to test it.


Bossa 0.2.0 "A New Hope", 2003-02-19
------------------------------------

* First release. Hello world! Brace yourself!

* Fully operational workflow engine.

* Workflow defined programmatically using Petri nets as modeling
  abstraction, using JavaScript expressions as edge weights.

* Register, unregister and list workflow definitions (case types).

* List cases, work item and activities by case type or case.

* Handle all life cycle of a workflow task: activation as work item,
  opening the work item as activity and finally the closing or
  cancellation of the activity.

* Resource management, with users and groups organized as access
  control lists.

* Resource specification in the case type using complex set
  expressions.

* Local resources by case type, allowing local mapping between case
  type resources and locally registered resources.

* Local resources by case, allowing more flexible resource
  specification.

* List work items and activities by resource capability.

* Transparent persistence. Uses only a writable directory, nothing
  more. 

* High quality, lightweight, commented and tested Java code.
