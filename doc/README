Docbook Documentation
=====================

To generate HTML renderings of our docbook documentation, it is
necessary to setup the style ant task and configure the Bossa build
script. Unfortunately, because there is no standard way of finding XML
catalogs and stylesheets portably between different operating systems
(or even Linux distributions) these instructions are a bit long.

The first step is to activate the style task of the ant build
system. This usually requires finding an XSL transformer (like Xalan)
and placing it either in the ant CLASSPATH or in its runtime lib
directory. For more info see the ant manual (http://ant.apache.org/manual/).

Now, it is necessary to tell the Bossa build where to find the XSL
stylesheet used to render HTML. If you don't have the stylesheet in
your system (most Linux distributions do, the problem is finding it),
download them from here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/docbook/
Unpack the stylesheet somewhere.

After finding or downloading the stylesheet, create a file named
"build.properties" in the Bossa directory, containing the following
line:

	docbook.xsl=<stylesheet-dir>/html/docbook.xsl

If you have the docbook 4.1.2 XML DTDs in your system, you can speed the
process a bit by adding this line to "build.properties". 

	docbookx.dtd=<docbook-XML-4.1.2-DTD-dir>/docbookx.dtd

Not that this last step is *optional*.

With everything in place, simply run:

	# ant docbook

The HTML documents will created in dist/doc/
